# Recipes - AI
![enter image description here](https://res.cloudinary.com/dloadb2bx/image/upload/v1718734943/yyynxzxcm546mz0ole4h.jpg)
Project developed with the aim of practicing the integration of OpenAI with software built using Ruby on Rails. Users can register recipes, with the preparation method generated by artificial intelligence, simply by entering the recipe name and ingredients. Despite being relatively straightforward, this project actively and directly practices the implementation of artificial intelligence resources in everyday solutions, capable of being used or developed for any other type of software.
